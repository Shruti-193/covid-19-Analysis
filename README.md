# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project is a comprehensive data analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using real-world datasets. It focuses on understanding the global impact of the virus, trends in case counts, deaths, and vaccination rates, and comparisons across countries over time. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook, and visualized with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze and visualize the global spread of COVID-19.
- Explore trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- Compare pandemic progression across countries.
- Evaluate the impact of vaccination programs.
- Derive insights from time-series and categorical data.
